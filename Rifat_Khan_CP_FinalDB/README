# Final Database Design and Implementation
**SQL Database Project**  
Repository: `Rifat_Khan_CP_FinalDB`  
Part of: `Data_Science_Masters` portfolio

## Overview

This project implements a fully functioning **relational database** using SQL. It demonstrates the complete database design lifecycle from conceptual modeling to physical implementation. The work includes a **physical ER diagram**, **table definitions (DDL)**, and **data manipulation scripts (DML)** to populate and manage the database.

The primary goals of this project are to:
- Design a normalized relational schema
- Visualize the database structure with a physical ER diagram
- Create database tables with appropriate constraints
- Populate sample data using DML
- Validate the schema and data with basic queries

### Directory Descriptions

- **diagrams/**: Contains the physical ER diagram visualizing tables, relationships, keys, and cardinalities.
- **ddl/**: SQL scripts that define the database structure (tables, primary/foreign keys, constraints).
- **dml/**: SQL scripts to insert, update, and delete records for testing and demonstration.
- **queries/**: Custom queries used to validate the database design and demonstrate usage.

## Physical ER Diagram

A physical Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created to define the schema, relationships, and constraints across entities.  
(Replace the file path below with the actual diagram path in this repo.)

![Physical ER Diagram](./diagrams/physical_er_diagram.png)

This diagram helps visualize:
- Entities and their attributes
- Primary and foreign keys
- One-to-many and many-to-many relationships

## Data Definition Language (DDL)

The DDL scripts define the structure of the database. They include:

```sql
-- Example snippet
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

Key features in DDL:

- Primary and foreign keys 
- NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints
- Referential integrity enforcement

Location:
/ddl/create_tables.sql  
/ddl/constraints.sql

Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML scripts handle the data content of the database:
-- Example snippet
INSERT INTO Customer (customer_id, first_name, last_name, email)
VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'Smith', 'alice.smith@example.com');

Scripts in this section:

- Insert initial sample data
- Update records
- Delete test data

How to Set Up and Run

Follow these steps to set up the database on your local system:

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/rifatkhan-main/Data_Science_Masters.git
cd Data_Science_Masters/Rifat_Khan_CP_FinalDB

Create the database and schema

- Open your SQL client (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, etc.)
- Run the DDL scripts in the ddl/ folder

SOURCE ddl/create_tables.sql;
SOURCE ddl/constraints.sql;


Populate data

- Execute the DML insert scripts
SOURCE dml/insert_data.sql;


Run validation queries

- Use the scripts in queries/validation_queries.sql to check data and referential structure.

Usage Example

After setup, you can run queries to explore the database:

-- Retrieve all customers
SELECT * FROM Customer;

-- Join orders with customers
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, o.order_date
FROM Customer c
JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

Key Features

- Well-defined relational schema with constraints
- Normalized design
- Sample data insertion and updates
- Demonstration queries for validation and exploration

Future Enhancements

Potential additions include:

- Stored procedures and triggers
- View definitions for reporting
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Integration with analytics or BI tools
